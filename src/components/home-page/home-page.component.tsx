          In October 1958, William Higinbotham created the very first video
          game, a very simple tennis game that used an oscilloscope as a screen.
          This marked the new era of gaming. Years later, the development never
          stopped. From Ms Pacman to Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog to Legend
          of Zelda. These 2D games is what started it all, evolving into 3D
          games that we have today. Furthermore, new games with Virtual Reality
          are being created. But with the evolution of technology, comes the
          dreaded idea of past technologies being left behind, from Atari
          consoles to the GameCube. Hence, with the production of these consoles
          being stopped, fewer 2D games were being created. A nova is an event
          that results in the creation of a new star. Just like a nova, gaming
          appeared and was created as a new star. Here at Nova, we reinvent and
          revitalise the lost era of 2D gaming and bring it into the modern
          world – recreated to a new star. Rekindling the fire it created when
          it dominated the 90s. A perfect harmony to the new generations of
          gaming devices and the art of 2D games. We build and continue building
          2D games, with the quality and excellence just as its predecessors
          brought, available to play on any platform – a perfect harmony of the
          past and the present.
